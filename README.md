Wages:
The connection between age and hourly wages is not a straight line; wages go up with age until a certain point, then they mostly stay the same. 
By adding a squared age term to the analysis, I get a better understanding of the data. And that it that it tends to change the model.
In the updated model, we see that workers with 16 years of education earn more in their middle ages, with the highest wages occurring around a specific age that the model predicts.
And people who are in the middle of thier lives tend to stay at a career for a while and therefore getting more money.

Ann Arbor: 
Rent is positively associated with square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The more bedrooms, the more bathrooms really.
A linear regression model provides a good fit to these data, and predicted rent for a 1,600-square-foot rental with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms is easily obtained from the model. Around 1492 for rent for this when I ran the model
Residual analysis shows no major violations of model assumptions and it shows that the model worked well.
